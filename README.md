Communication between 2 process with signals

The use of sigaction was forbidden.

The client sends a message to the server, which displays it.
I used a ping-pong system (just like TCP) and binary mask in order to send / receive the text.

Usage : ./server
        ./client pid_server text  

Bonus:

      - Fast
      - Low CPU usage
      - Test script, in "tests" folder
